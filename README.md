# TamaBotchy
## TamaBotchy is inspired by the question that I keep asking- how the heck do tamagotchi's tell time
### Current Implementations
 Save system, randomized attribtues for tama, system-time based time keeping, health and hunger with the ability to feed and heal
 
### Next Goals
 With the major backbones complete, next focuses will be on:
  - Implementing auto-saving
  - Aging
  - Applying effects to tama upon loading. These will be based on the time difference between when the last save was and the current time on loading to create the illusion that time has in fact passed in your tama's world
  - "Hatching" the tama from an egg when starting a new game
  - Death and game over scenario
  
 ### Future Goals
  These might be getting into a little bit of scope creep and need to be thought about further. These might also be dependent on art assets. 
   - Breeding tamas
     - "Genetics" system where the new tama born will have traits based on the parent's traits with a small chance of mutations
     - Nature vs nurture- scalling attribtues to not be as binary, and based on how its cared for adjusting the scale accordingly
   - More interactions
     - Praising and scolding
     - Minigames
   - Shop and inventory
